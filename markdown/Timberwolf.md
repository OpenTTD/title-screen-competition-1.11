# Timberwolf

Some hilly subtropical terrain, harking back to the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe title game, although desert rather than rainforest this time. I've aimed for some of the same feel with not making things too "busy" or trying to cram something into every tile, but working with the landscape and having a nice laid-back network while still showing some possibilities like RoRo stations for horizontal resolutions >1600px. And of course lots of town tunnels!
